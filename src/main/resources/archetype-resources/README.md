KNIME node skeleton with sample code as described [here](https://tech.knime.org/developer-guide).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/${github_organization}/${github_repository}.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/${github_organization}/${github_repository})

This project uses [Eclipse Tycho](https://www.eclipse.org/tycho/) to perform build steps.

${symbol_pound} Installation

Requirements:

* KNIME, https://www.knime.org, version ${knime_version} or higher

Steps to get the ${node} KNIME node inside KNIME:

1. Goto Help > Install new software ... menu
2. Press add button
3. Fill text fields with url of update site which contains this node.
4. Select --all sites-- in `work with` pulldown
5. Select the node
6. Install software
7. Restart KNIME

${symbol_pound} Usage

1. Create a new KNIME workflow.
2. Find node in Node navigator panel.
3. Drag node to workflow canvas.

${symbol_pound} Build

```
mvn verify
```

An Eclipse update site will be made in `p2/target/repository` directory.
The update site can be used to perform a local installation.

${symbol_pound} Development

Steps to get development environment setup:

1. Download KNIME SDK from https://www.knime.org/downloads/overview
2. Install/Extract/start KNIME SDK
3. Start SDK
4. Install m2e (Maven integration for Eclipse) + KNIME Testing framework

    1. Goto Help > Install new software ...
    2. Make sure Update site is http://update.knime.org/analytics-platform/3.1 is in the pull down list otherwise add it
    3. Select --all sites-- in work with pulldown
    4. Select m2e (Maven integration for Eclipse)
    5. Select `KNIME Testing framework`
    6. Install software & restart

5. Import this repo as an Existing Maven project

During import the Tycho Eclipse providers must be installed.

${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound} Tests

Tests for the node are in `tests/src` directory.
Tests can be executed with `mvn verify`, they will be run in a separate KNIME environment.
Test results will be written to `test/target/surefire-reports` directory.

${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound} Unit tests

Unit tests written in Junit4 format can be put in `tests/src/java`.
